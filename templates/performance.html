		Gotham Project is an interactive performance consisting of three live projection screens, electronic musical interfaces and interactive costumes. We wanted to explore the possibilities of live performance. We incorporated multiple principles of performance art such as experimental theatre, interactive installation, and new interfaces for musical expression.
